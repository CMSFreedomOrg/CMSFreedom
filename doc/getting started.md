# Getting Started

CMSFreedom is a Chromium extension which is used to obtain key information from a static HTML page and process both the HTML and CSS code ready to import to your chosen CRM.

# Installing the extension
The latest version of the extension is available through the Chrome Web Store. (link). 

# Using the extension
Once installed, navigate to the relevant website and click the extension icon to begin the process of processing the website you're on. This may take a few moments whilst three screenshots are taken of the website content and while the LLM processes the content.  

Once processed, the system will then load WordPress Playground in a new tab window with the content of your website inside WordPress.

# Saving and exporting your site
WordPress Playground runs within your browser. When you close the window, or refresh the page, you'll lose any content you've created or which has been processed by the plugin.  

Therefore, once completed, you can follow the [WordPress Playground](https://wordpress.github.io/wordpress-playground/quick-start-guide#save-your-site) instructions to download and export your website.
