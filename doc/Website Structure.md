# Website Structure 

CMSFreedom has been built with the intention to integrate with other CMS platforms at a later point. During the Hackathon, WordPress was chosen as the initial system due to the background of the team members involved.  

The project welcomes other contributors to help support the creation of additional 'connectors' to allow for the output of the tool to populate other CMS platforms.
