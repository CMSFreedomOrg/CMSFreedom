This is a "single" view render of a page on a CMS. As a "single" view there is a
central "post" or "object" being rendered in a "main content" region. This region
is found within a much broader layout. Every post or object is rendered with the
same template, but the content within the "main content" region is pulled from
the specific post or object in a database.

Usually these areas are found within some kind of <main>, <article>, or <div> tag,
and they usually have CSS classes indicating that they are the main content. Within
this same container element is usually a CSS class name or a custom data attribute
indicating some kind of ID or GUID or UUID which refers to the specific post or
object being rendered.

Create a CSS selector which points to this main content region and try to find the
ID corresponding to the specific post being rendered in this single view. If you can
find the ID return it with the CSS selector with the property name "id". If you cannot
find the ID then return a value of "null" for the "id" property.
